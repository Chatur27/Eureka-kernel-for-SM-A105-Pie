					GLITCH OBSERVED WITH KERNEL

When phone is just booted, little cores cannot be overclocked above 1482 MHz when changed in a kernel manager.
Change governor for litte cluster to "userspace" and then change both max and min freq
to 1690 MHz.

                  MAIN FEATURES OF REV 3.0

1) Disabled Samsung security features (E.g: defex, dm verity, rooting restrictions, knox ncmâ€¦)

2) Disabled CRC check on data blocks which improves performance and also enabled toggleable CRC check feature.

3) Removed dirty status from scripts for github.

4) Enabled all governors except Schedutils governor.

5) Overclocked CPU as follows:
	BIG Cores: from 1560 MHz to 2080 MHz.
	LIL Cores: from 1352 MHz to 1690 MHz.

6) Removed a bunch of debugging and logging codes

7) Added GPU thermal and voltage control (Can be controlled in HkTweaks) 

8) Added latest boeffla_wl_blocker V 1.1.0 and disabled some wakelocks.

9) Some optimisations for overall performance in kernel

10) Balance battery and performance by reducing CPU wake-ups

11) Added NEON accelerated XOR implementation which improves performance by about 20%

12) Use neon-vfpv4 and softfp

13) Enabled support for NTFS filesystems.

14) Use TCP Congestion algorithm instead of BIC (network speed improvement)

15) Added battery control 

16) Optimized cpufreq and interactive governor.

17) Use -O3 optimization for inputs and crypto

18) Defined new cpumasks for big and little clusters (will be used by future commits)

19) GPU max frequency overclocked from 676 MHz to 1300 MHz

20) Underclocked CPU as follows:
	BIG Cores: from 728 MHz to 312 MHz.
	LIL Cores: from 449 MHz to 208 MHz.

21) Removed CPU input boost from previous versions because it was making the device laggy at some point.
	
	
                  MAIN FEATURES OF REV 3.9

22) Disabled more securities which could result in bootloop.

23) Enable zram support and set default compressor as lz4.

24) Reduced transition latency for cpu frequencies.

25) Removed verity flag from dt.

26) Allow undervolting of gpu by 100 mV (I was informed that you get more playing time if enabled!).

27) Switch to a lower charging voltage more quickly. This results in a slight reduce in battery capacity
(about 3% less usable capacity) but this helps to extend the cycle life of the battery.

28) Reviewed cpu overclock and underclock codes.

29) Adjusted default gpu highspeed frequency.

30) Overclock gpu max frequency to 1300 MHz (High battery drain and overheat).

31) Upstream LZ4 compressor module and other related optimisations.

32) Implemented Dynamic FSync 2.0 (Disables Fsync when screen is on so as to improve performance)

33) Reduced touchscreen touch latency (To solve a bug on I2C).


                 MAIN FEATURES OF REV 4.0

34) Optimise kernel for performance instead of size

35) Built with Linaro V4.9.4 toolchain. Reason: Better performance

36) Other performance tweaks.. (developper Gabriel helped)

37) Enable deadline I/O scheduler (by developper Gabriel)

38) ...
